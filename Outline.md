Workshop Topics
+ Reading Data
+ Cleaning Data
+ Regular Expressions

(Probably too ambitious for 2 hours.)


+ Cleaning data requires judgement and decision making in the presence of ambiguity.
  + You should explicitly record your decisions and actions (for you and others)
  + You should return to review your decisions and see how they affect conclusions/insights.
