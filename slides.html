# Goals

+ Process of cleaning data
+ Intersection:  Regular Expressions
   + pattern matching and substitution in text
+ Reading non-tabular data into R.

---

# Cleaning Data

+ Cleaning data requires judgment and decision making in the presence of ambiguity.
  + You need to ask the owner and collector(s) of the data to explain possible issues.
  + You should explicitly record your decisions and actions (for you and others)
  + You should return to review your decisions and see how they affect conclusion

+ Cleaning requires thought about how the data collection could lead to errors.
   + Often general problems, but always possible context-specific issues.

+ Cleaning should exist as part of the data life cycle, not separate
from it.

---

See [Barley.md](Barley.md)

---

# The Data Lifecycle

+ Reproducability is essential.
   + Across sessions
   + Code
   + People

Is this how we use data?

<img src="linear.png" alt="USGS Data lifecycle" style="width: 800px;"/>

---

# Data Lifecycle (cont.)

+ In most cases, this is a cycle, not linear/sequential but highly iterative. E.g., 

  + Data created
  + Cleaned/processed 
  + "Used" in some way
  + Find issues! Go back to cleaning...
  + Add more data
  + Clean so more
  + Share with others
  + They find issues! Go back to cleaning... 

+ Often, multiple people working on the data simulteneously in different stages/phases.
  + even you have multiple roles
  + writing code & fixing original file simultaneously

+ What if the original data is changed after it is cleaned?

+ What if the end or intermediate use is in Excel/GoogleSheets/OpenRefine, etc.?

---
# Program defensively!

Don't assume:
+ The data will never change
+ You will forever remember what you were doing in this moment
+ Your assumptions are correct (e.g., you might need to go back and correct
  a bad "fix")
+ You understand perfectly how errors occurred

Aim to write software rather than scripts

---

# Writing a script vs. software

+ script: fixes instances, (maybe) specialized to the data, assumes the data are
static. Breaks if the data change, assumes a linear workflow.

```
> df[12, 3] = "Bob"
```
Why row 12? Why column 3? What if Dr. Smarty-pants inserts a new
column in position 1?

+ software: flexible to fix conditions, not specific instances. Data
can change without breaking script

```
> df$names[df$names == "bob"] = "Bob" 
```
Invariant to order of rows/columns. If the data are already corrected,
has no effect.

But writing software is more effort (higher cost), requires more thought.

# R Functions which use Regex



+ grep() and grepl()
   + Find which elements the pattern matches.  
+ gregexpr()/regexpr() and  regmatches()
   + Find where in each element the pattern matches
+ sub()/gsub()
   + Substitute text for pattern match. (Dynamic)
+ strsplit()
   + Split a vector of strings, each into multiple elements
+ adist()
   + Edit distance to see which strings are "close"
+ agrep()
   + Fuzzy/approximate matching of a pattern


+ Others from stringr and stringi packages.
   + e.g. str_extract()

+ All Vectorized functions.

## Shell Commands

+ grep, egrep, ag
+ find

+ Regular expressions versus Shell globbing!
---

# Regex Extensions

  + Non-greedy Matching
      + Problems with greedy matching.
  	  + Common simple case, simple solution
	     + Anything except this character
	     + or any of these characters
      + *?

+ Positive Lookahead and Behind

+ Negative Lookahead and Behind

---
## Literals

Matches to the literal characters.

```
> strings = c("My dog is cool.", "My cat is cooler.")

> grep("dog", strings)
[1] 1

```

```
grep("cool", strings)
```
  Matches both.

```
grep("cooler", strings)
```
 Matches just one.



---
					
## Wildcard Character  `.`

Matches **any** character.

```
> strings = c("cat", "hat", "bat", "4at", "Manhattan")

> grep(".at", strings)
[1] 1 2 3 4 5

```
Can be extremely useful, or create havoc. Use caution.

---

## Escaping Characters


+ So how do we find a . if it is treated as any character?

+ Common mistake: intend to match "." without escaping:

```
strings = c("www.google.com","wwwhat?!?")

grep("www.", strings)
[1] 1 2

grep("www\\.", strings)
[1] 1 
```



---
## Character Classes

Matches any character in a set of specified characters inside of `[]`.

```
> strings = c("cat", "hat", "bat", "4at", "Manhattan")

> grep("[bc]at", strings)
[1] 1 3

```

Shorthand for classes of characters, include:

+ numbers: `[0-9]` or `[[:digit:]]`

+ letters: `[A-z]` (all), `[A-Z]` (uppercase), `[a-z]` (lowercase),
`[[:alpha:]]`

+ alphanumeric: `[[:alnum:]]`

+ space characters: `[[:space:]]`, e.g. tab `\t` or space `\s`

+ punctuation: `[[:punct:]]`

---
## Character Classes (examples)

+ Any alphabetic

```
> strings = c("Abc", "abc", "123", "Abc123")

> grep("[A-z]", strings) 
[1] 1 2 4
```
+ Any lower-case alphabetic

```
> grep("[a-z]", strings) 
[1] 1 2 4
```
+ Any digit

```
> grep("[0-9]", strings) 
[1] 3 4
```
+ Any alphanumeric

```
> grep("[A-z0-9]", strings)
[1] 1 2 3 4
```
---
## Character Classes (examples, cont.)

You can specify a partial range inside the `[]` as well

```
strings = c("a", "z", "1", "9")
```
+ Only match letters "a" through "g"
```
> grep("[a-g]", strings)
[1] 1 
```
+ only match numbers 0 through 5
```
> grep("[0-5]", strings)
[1] 4
```
---
## Negated Character Classes

Uses `^` inside of `[]` to negate the match, i.e., match everything
except those characters.
```
> strings = c("Abc", "abc", "123", "Abc123")

```
+ Contains non-alphabetic
```
> grep("[^A-z]", strings)
[1] 3 4
```

+ Contains non-lower case
```
> grep("[^a-z]", strings)
[1] 1 3 4
```

+ Contains any non-digit
```
> grep("[^0-9]", strings)
[1] 3 4
```

---
## Positional Matching - Anchors  `^` `$`

Matches the beginning (`^`) or end (`$`) of the string. Used outside
of `[]`

```
> strings = c("cat", "bat", "check", "China")

> grep("^c", strings) #First character is "c"
[1] 1 3

> grep("t$", strings) # Last character is "t"
[1] 1 2

```

---

## Alternation

Matches multiple patterns by using the `|` (called the "pipe", shift + key above
"Enter" key on US keyboards) 

```
> strings = c("cat", "bat", "check", "China")
> grep("hat|coat", strings)
[1] 3 4
```

---
## Case Insensitive matching

Most regex functions have an option to `ignore.case`

```
> strings = c("Cat", "cat", "CAT", "bat", "Hat")

> grep("cat", strings, ignore.case = TRUE)
[1] 1 2 3
```
---
## Word boundaries

Useful when looking for a word that occurs as a pattern inside other
words. Specified with:

+  either beginning or end of word: `\\b`
+  beginning of word: `\\<`
+  end of word: `\\>`

```
> strings = c("This", "is", "Mississippi")
> grep("is", strings)
[1] 1 2 3 

> grep("is\\>", strings)
[1] 1 2 

> grep("\\bis\\b", strings)
[1] 2 
```

---
## Quantifiers

+ Optional pattern: `?` character can occur 0 or 1 times
```
> strings = c("abc", "ac", "abbc")
> grep("ab?c", strings)
[1] 1 2
```
+ Zero or more  *
```
> grep("ab*c", strings)
[1] 1 2 3
```
+ One or more  \+
```
> grep("ab+c", strings)
[1] 1 3
```
---
## Quantifiers (cont.)

+ m or more   `{m,}`
```
> grep("ab{2,}c", strings)
[1] 3
```
+ n or fewer   `{,n}`
```
> grep("ab{2,}c", strings)
[1] 1 2 3
```
+ between m and n  `{m,n}`
```
> grep("ab{1,2}c", strings)
[1] 1 3
```

---
## Grouping and Back-References ()

+  `()` and `\\1`, `\\2`, etc.

Allows you to refer to part of a match by enclosing it in `()`. `\\1`
refers to the first match captured, `\\2` the second, and so on...

Really useful in `gsub()` to "grab" pieces out of a string:

```
> strings = c("I want this 5 and this 9 separated by a '-'.")

> gsub(".*([0-9]).*([0-9]).*", "\\1 - \\2", strings)
[1] "5 - 9"
```
---


# All Special Characters

Special characters include

+ ( and )
+ [ and ]
+ .
+ ^ $
+ \
+ * ? + { }
+ |



```
> strings = c("This is a period: '.' ", "There is no period here")

> grep(".", strings)
[1] 1 2

> grep("\\.", strings)
[1] 1

```

---


## Extensions

+ Like all languages, there are useful extensions, dialects
+ By default, R uses POSIX extended regular expressions
   + perl = FALSE
+ Can use richer PCRE - Perl Compatible Regular Expressions
   + perl = TRUE

+ Available in Perl, Python (but different), C++, etc.
   + Check documentation and with example code.

---
### Non-greedy Matching
+ Problems with greedy matching.

+ Common simple case, simple solution

+ Anything except this character
  + or any of these characters
  + `*?`
  
---
### Positive Lookahead and Behind
+ `(?=  )`   `(?<= )`

---	
### Negative Lookahead and Behind
+ `(?!  )`   `(?<! )`	


---
### Groups for backreferencs

+ Non-capture of groups
+ Named groups
