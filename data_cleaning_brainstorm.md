## Brain storm about Data science

still collect in Excel - multiple sheets for different types of sheets

Google Docs - 

One directory - one for each lab

Save as .csv at end - import to R

collect data in format needed in end

consistency is key - be descriptive (take notes) 
  - in sheet
  - lab notebook
  - all kept together
  - 
  
## Data cleaning

Directory for data that does not get touched - no cleaning in Excel

Never work on raw data - keep raw data separate

take notes - in script and elsewhere text file

Reproducibility vs. Repeatability

scripts kept separate

Github? Worth learning

contrained input - e.g., google docs

## Recommended practices

  - War story: Pictures
  - The problem - you don't see issues until late in the game
  - Success story: make life easier in long run
  - Get a plan
	- concepts
	- 
  - Think 
  - constantly evolving, tools improving
  - don't learn writing by copying sentences, concepts reqiure more work
  - bet future on skill sets

	- Grad students/post-docs
	- Target entry-level R
	  - What you did not learn in your stats classes
	  - have seen, but not confident
	  - before you start modeling

TO DO:
 - google form / event bright ~40 people
 - dates 
 - data set for examples - sim,
   - USDA AR weather data - cleaning
   - USDA manipulation
 - topics
 - 2 days, 3 hours w/break - hands on, brainstorm
 - 23rd and 30th? 19th? 
 - checklist : guided list
 
 - why are we here 
   - motivation
   - what can go wrong
   - 
   
 - Break apart brainstorm (10 min)
 - list we make (~20 min mark)
   - guidelines
   - 

 Example:
 - read in data
 - explain data types
 
 Core data types:
   - matrix vs data.frame
   - print to console vs. actual data type
   
 Guidelines:
   - Check class
   - classes of variables
   - unique values
   - distributions (text & graphics)
	 - categorical 
	 - numeric
	 - incorrect levels (typos)
	 - 
   - names
   - dims
   - verify random rows vs. top/bottom
   - missing values - distribution/location
	 - drift
	 - missing in time
	 - systematic error
   - outliers/inliers
   - implied NAs (e.g. 999)
   - groups - check expected number
   - merge
   - verify
   - conversion to date/time
   
Default - 4 hours, drop in session

TO DO:
- flesh out guidelines
- date
- annoucement - Tues/Thurs
